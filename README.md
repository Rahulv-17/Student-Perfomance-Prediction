# Student-Perfomance-Prediction
This project predicts studentsâ€™ final performance using a real-world student performance dataset. It uses data preprocessing and a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that learns from features like study time, previous grades, and family background. The trained model outputs the predicted final grade.
