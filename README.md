# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using ANN

This project aims to predict a student's final academic performance using a **Supervised Machine Learning** approach. An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model is built to learn from various academic and personal attributes and estimate the final result accurately.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Predict student final grades based on input features
- Understand key factors influencing performance
- Compare prediction results with actual grades
- Support educational decision-making and early intervention

---

## 🧠 Model Used
👉 **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**  
Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**, trained using backpropagation for continuous grade prediction.

📊 Metrics Used:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
